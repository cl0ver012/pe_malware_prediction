## Requirements

Python 3 and necessary libraries given in requirements.txt (or) req.txt.

Install the required libraries using the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) package manager.

For pip version 19.1 or above:

~~~bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --user
~~~

or

~~~bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user
~~~

## Future Scopes

* Build different Neural Network architectures involving Convolutions and Recurrent cells.
* Use a different sampling method to overcome classs imbalance.
